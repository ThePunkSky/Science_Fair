The luminous flux measurements were conducted across varying Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) duty cycles (10%, 30%, 50%, 70%, 90%) in five trials. The mean luminous flux values, recorded in lux, reveal a consistent trend: as the duty cycle increases, there is a corresponding rise in luminous flux. The control group, set at a duty cycle of 100%, maintains a relatively high mean luminous flux. The standard deviations indicate relatively low variability in the data, emphasizing the stability of the observed trends. These findings suggest a positive correlation between higher PWM duty cycles and increased luminous output in high-power Light Emitting Diodes (LEDs).
